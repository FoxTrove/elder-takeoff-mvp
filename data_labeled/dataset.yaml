# YOLOv8 Dataset Configuration
# Update the paths and class names based on your specific use case

# Dataset paths (relative to this file)
path: ../data_labeled  # dataset root dir
train: images  # train images (relative to 'path')
val: images    # val images (relative to 'path') - for MVP, using same as train

# Classes
names:
  0: outlet  # Change this to your target object (e.g., 'door', 'window', 'fixture')

# Notes:
# - For MVP, we're using the same images for training and validation
# - In production, split your data into separate train/val/test sets
# - Add more classes as needed (e.g., 1: door, 2: window, etc.)
